So yeah this'll be a short post. I've decided that because I somewhat lack
things to show I'll try to have a much bigger presence on this blog and on
github.

In this post I will hopefully keep track of my repositories at: 
[https://github.com/bartosz-witkowski](https://github.com/bartosz-witkowski)


Books
=====

This is my experiment in "working through" books. I wanted to start with a
classic "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programss" then try to work
through "The Art of Prolog" or maybe something else.

latex-cx-class
==============

See [this post](/2013/07/15/creating-classes-in-latex.html)

Future
======

Apart from my book experiment I'm toying with the idea of having a repository
for my implementations of "stuff" from articles from arxiv/blog posts or other
interesting sources. Another idea I have is to put up my university assignments
but I fear that they are such low quality that putting them up wouldn't be the
best idea.
