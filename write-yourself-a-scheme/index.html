  I don't even remember when I started writing the Write Yourself a Scheme

  You can find parts of the unfinished tutorial below, a finished uncleaned working implementation of the interpreter can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/bartosz-witkowski/write-yourself-a-scheme/tree/master/scratchpad">scratchpad directory of the tutorial repository</a>.
